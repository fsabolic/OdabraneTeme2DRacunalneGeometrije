# Computational 2D Geometry Thesis

## Overview

This repository hosts my bachelor's thesis project, "Selected Topics in Computational 2D Geometry." The project explores fundamental geometric problems and shows famous implementations of mathematical and algorithmic methods to offer efficient solutions. All implementations are done in Python, and visualizations are provided using Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The implementation language chosen for its simplicity and readability.
- **Matplotlib**: Utilized for visualizing the solutions to the geometric problems.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. **Segment Intersection**: Algorithms for identifying intersections between line segments.
2. **Point in Polygon**: Techniques to determine whether a point lies inside a polygon.
3. **Convex Hull**: Methods for finding the convex hull of a set of points.
4. **Boolean Operations on Polygons**: Algorithms for performing Boolean operations like union, intersection, and difference on polygons.
5. **Point Set Triangulation**: Strategies for dividing a set of points into non-intersecting triangles.
6. **Voronoi Diagram**: Construction of Voronoi diagrams based on a set of input points.
